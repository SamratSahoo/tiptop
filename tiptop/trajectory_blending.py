"""Blend + re-time a cuTAMP plan so consecutive arm motions read like one continuous stroke.

A cuTAMP plan is a sequence of independently-planned trajectory segments (retract -> approach ->
grasp, etc.) separated by gripper open/close steps. Every segment is a cuRobo *reaching* motion, so
it accelerates from rest and decelerates back to rest at each of its endpoints. Concatenated, the
arm therefore comes to a full stop at every interior waypoint -- a stop-and-go, per-segment velocity
profile with ~20 zero-velocity dips, quite unlike a human teleop demo, which flows through the
reach and only slows near the grasp/place itself.

This module collapses that: it groups the consecutive trajectory segments *between gripper events*
and replaces each group with a single smooth stroke that comes to rest only at its ends -- which are
exactly the gripper-actuation points, where the arm genuinely should be still for a reliable
grasp/place. Each stroke is built by path-velocity decomposition:

* Geometry. The group's joined waypoints are fit with a penalized cubic SMOOTHING spline in joint
  space, parameterized by arc length. The penalty rounds the sharp direction changes at the old
  segment joins (which an interpolating spline would overshoot, producing large phantom
  accelerations) while staying close to the collision-checked path (~1 deg joint deviation at the
  default smoothing).

* Timing. A quintic time law sweeps along the path with a smooth (min-jerk-like) bell-shaped speed
  profile. At the plan's true rest points (episode start/end) it comes fully to rest (this is the
  6t^5-15t^4+10t^3 minimum-jerk quintic, the standard model of human reaching). At gripper-adjacent
  boundaries it instead ends/starts at a small NONZERO boundary speed: the min-jerk quintic ramps so
  gently through zero that it leaves a long run of near-zero-velocity frames on both sides of the
  gripper event, and the DROID/openpi non-idle training filter drops idle joint-velocity runs (>=7
  frames at 15 Hz), which would take the gripper open/close timestep with them. Carrying a nonzero
  boundary speed keeps the only zero-velocity frames at a gripper event to the short (~3-frame)
  stationary hold the export inserts for the actuation itself -- comfortably under the filter's run
  length. The arm still slows into the grasp/place (the boundary speed is a small fraction of cruise)
  and its final commanded POSITION is exactly the grasp, so there is no overshoot.

  A symmetric bell makes the endpoint the stroke's SLOWEST point, so the boundary speed it can carry is
  capped at ``_MAX_BOUNDARY_SLOPE`` * the stroke average (monotonicity): on a slow (heavily time-dilated)
  operation that clamps the transition back into the idle band, and an endpoint-tangent collapse at a
  grasp reversal clamps it further. Setting ``blend_boundary_window`` > 0 switches to an asymmetric time
  law (:func:`_asymmetric_stroke`) that holds the plan pace through the middle and carries the boundary
  speed only within that window at each end -- a strictly-positive (monotonic) speed profile with no
  such cap, so the transition clears the idle band while the careful mid-approach stays slow.

* Pace / limits. The stroke's duration starts at the group's original wall-clock (so a
  ``time_dilation_factor``-slowed plan stays slow, just continuous) and is then shortened PER STROKE
  only as much as its own gripper-adjacent boundary speed requires -- never globally. This matters
  because the boundary joint speed is capped at ``_MAX_BOUNDARY_SLOPE`` times the stroke AVERAGE
  (the min-jerk endpoints are its slowest point), so at a slow pace ``blend_boundary_speed`` is
  silently clamped and the arm crawls through gripper open/close -- which a velocity-command policy
  learns to stall on. Shortening only the strokes that would clamp lifts their transition speed to the
  request while leaving strokes already fast enough (and the cruise of the rest of the plan) at their
  original careful pace. The shortening is bounded by the robot's REAL joint velocity/acceleration
  limits (from ``motion_gen``); a transition unreachable within those limits (e.g. a rounded grasp
  cusp) is left at the original pace and logged, not chased by over-speeding the whole stroke.
  ``blend_speed_scale`` (default 1.0) is an optional EXTRA global multiplier on top, rarely needed now.

Calibration: on this repo's teleop demos the human joint-jerk RMS is ~3-6; the default smoothing is
tuned so the blended strokes land in that same band (i.e. as smooth as the human data), not smoother
and blurrier, nor sharper and more robotic.

Collision caveat: smoothing rounds the sharp corners at the old segment joins, so the blended path is
NOT identical to the one cuRobo collision-checked (largest deviation at those corners, ~1 deg joint at
the default). This is the same rounding a human demo has, but validate in sim / on the viz before
trusting it near tight obstacles.

Blending is OFF by default and opt-in per config: set ``blend_trajectory: true`` under
``tamp_overrides`` in a ``cfg/tamp/*.yml`` (see :func:`resolve_blend_config`). This is a pure
post-process over the joint-waypoint arrays (no planner changes); it runs in ``run_planning`` so the
saved plan and the executed plan are the identical blended object.
