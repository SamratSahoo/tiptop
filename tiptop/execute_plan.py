# --- Gripper/arm overlap ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# A TAMP plan issues each gripper open/close as its own step, sandwiched between two arm
# trajectories (arrive -> actuate -> depart). Executing that step and waiting for the gripper to
# finish parks the arm for the full ~0.5-1 s actuation, which the LeRobot export records as a run
# of zero-velocity frames. The DROID-style non-idle training filter then drops any idle
# joint-velocity run of >= 7 frames -- and the gripper open/close timestep sits right inside it,
# so it is filtered out.
#
# We overlap the actuation with the FOLLOWING trajectory (the lift after a close, the retreat
# after an open) so the arm keeps moving across the transition. On a Robotiq the gripper talks to
# the gripper server on its OWN socket, separate from the arm control socket, so we run the command
# on a background thread and start the next trajectory concurrently on the control socket; the
# transition then lands inside a moving (non-idle) segment and survives the filter.
#
# The threaded command MUST be issued blocking=False + polled client-side (see _spawn_gripper_command
# and _wait_for_gripper_settled), NOT as a server-side blocking command. The gripper server handles
# requests on a single thread: a blocking command occupies it for the whole actuation, starving the
# LeRobot gripper sampler's state polls so the recorded open<->close ramp collapses to an instant
# jump. A background thread frees only the *client*, not the server; the client-side poll frees the
# server socket between reads. (This was the "gripper obs jumps" regression -- see git history.)
#
# Only overlapped when the gripper has a separate socket (Robotiq). A Franka hand routes gripper
# commands through the control socket, so a thread would race the arm trajectory -- there we fall
# back to the blocking path. Set TIPTOP_GRIPPER_OVERLAP=0 to force the blocking hold everywhere.

# object before the lift begins. This stationary settle is the only idle window left, so keep it
# comfortably below min_idle_len / fps (~7/15 = 0.47 s) or it becomes a filtered idle run itself:
# ~0.2 s is ~3 export frames, well under the 7-frame threshold, while the rest of the close
# overlaps the (moving) lift. Main grasp-reliability knob -- raise toward ~0.3 s if objects slip,
# lower toward 0 for a pure swoop grasp that relies on gripper force control during the lift.

    ``execute_trajectory``, computed once client-side and passed identically to both submissions,
    consumed by ``TrajectoryStreamer._stream`` in place of ``now`` -- not built here because it
    should only be built if the measurement demands it.

    Requires the server's trajectory queue (the same capability :class:`_QueuedArm` probes for);

    arms' columns on every trajectory segment and names one or two hands per gripper step
    (``arm``/``arms``, see :func:`tiptop.planning.serialize_plan`), different enough in shape from
    the single-arm per-step client-scoping that threading it through the existing loop would
    obscure both paths. Motion goes through :class:`_DualQueuedArm`, the same queued wire protocol
    ``execute_cutamp_plan`` uses, just issued twice per segment (see that class's synchronization
    caveat -- it has not been validated against real hardware timing).

    A handover's gripper ordering -- the taker closes, THEN the giver opens, with no trajectory step
    between them in the raw cuTAMP plan (``motion_solver.py``'s ``Handover`` branch) -- is a physical
    safety requirement: the held object must never be unsupported. It is hard-sequenced here (wait
    for the close to actually settle, via polled gripper state, before the open is even issued) and
    is NOT run through ``execute_cutamp_plan``'s overlap-with-next-motion optimization, which exists
    for data-quality reasons and must not be allowed to reorder or race this pair.

    If ``timeline`` is provided, one entry per plan step is appended (in order), each
    ``{"type", "label", "t_start", "t_end"}`` with wall-clock (epoch) seconds -- same contract as
