# --- Gripper/arm overlap ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# A TAMP plan issues each gripper open/close as its own step, sandwiched between two arm
# trajectories (arrive -> actuate -> depart). Executing that step and waiting for the gripper to
# finish parks the arm for the full ~0.5-1 s actuation, which the LeRobot export records as a run
# of zero-velocity frames. The DROID-style non-idle training filter then drops any idle
# joint-velocity run of >= 7 frames -- and the gripper open/close timestep sits right inside it,
# so it is filtered out.
#
# We overlap the actuation with the FOLLOWING trajectory (the lift after a close, the retreat
# after an open) so the arm keeps moving across the transition. The bamboo gripper command blocks
# until the gripper physically settles (the server does NOT honour blocking=False -- confirmed on
# hardware), but on a Robotiq it talks to the gripper server on its OWN socket, separate from the
# arm control socket. So we run the blocking command on a background thread and start the next
# trajectory concurrently on the control socket; the transition then lands inside a moving
# (non-idle) segment and survives the filter.
#
# Only overlapped when the gripper has a separate socket (Robotiq). A Franka hand routes gripper
# commands through the control socket, so a thread would race the arm trajectory -- there we fall
# back to the blocking path. Set TIPTOP_GRIPPER_OVERLAP=0 to force the blocking hold everywhere.
GRIPPER_OVERLAP = os.environ.get("TIPTOP_GRIPPER_OVERLAP", "1") != "0"

# Seconds to stay parked after firing a CLOSE before the arm departs, so the fingers seat on the
# object before the lift begins. This stationary settle is the only idle window left, so keep it
# comfortably below min_idle_len / fps (~7/15 = 0.47 s) or it becomes a filtered idle run itself:
# ~0.2 s is ~3 export frames, well under the 7-frame threshold, while the rest of the close
# overlaps the (moving) lift. Main grasp-reliability knob -- raise toward ~0.3 s if objects slip,
# lower toward 0 for a pure swoop grasp that relies on gripper force control during the lift.
